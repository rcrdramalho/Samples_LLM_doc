/**
 * @brief Main function to calculate the sum of integers entered by the user.
 *
 * This program prompts the user to enter the number of integers they want to sum,
 * then dynamically allocates memory to store those integers. It then reads the
 * integers from the user, calculates their sum, and prints the result.
 * Finally, it releases the allocated memory.
 *
 * @return 0 if the program executes successfully, 1 if memory allocation fails.
